# Langchain-Learning

This Jupyter Notebook is my attempt to explore the LangChain framework, focusing on how it interacts with Large Language Models (LLMs) and supports features like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic Workflows. The project is set up for experimentation without a specific end goal. Users are expected to install necessary dependencies through Pipenv. The notebook requires a .env file containing a Hugging Face API key for LLM configuration. It can also be adapted to use different models or APIs.

The notebook's functionality includes loading content from various sources, splitting it into manageable chunks, vectorizing these chunks for semantic search, and creating queries to process through the LLM. It utilizes Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) for efficient retrieval of relevant content chunks, based on the queries. Responses are generated for each chunk and compiled to provide insights or answers based on the content.

This setup is ideal for anyone looking to delve into the practical applications of LLMs and learn about AI-driven data processing workflows in a flexible, modifiable environment.
